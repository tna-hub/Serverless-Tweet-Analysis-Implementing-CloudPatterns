## Serverless Tweet Analysis Implementing Cloud Pattern

This repo contains the python code for a cloud RESTful application that analyses sentiment from tweets.

It implements two cloud patterns (proxy pattern and sharding pattern) using postgresql schema as database instances.

The aim of the project is to analyse the impact of different cloud patterns on the performance of a cloud application.

The [full paper](https://github.com/tna-hub/Serverless-Tweet-Analysis-Implementing-CloudPatterns/blob/master/final%20paper.pdf) of the project is available in this repository (with instructions on how to replicate).
